MISSION: Build the Ultimate Digital Business Command Center for built4you.org

You are now the lead architect for a revolutionary digital agency platform. Your task is to build a website and client dashboard that is not just a tool, but an experience. This is for "Built4You," a company that does everything for small businesses: websites, automation, Google Business Profiles, SMMA, ads, and more. The design must be unique, immersive, and functionally insane.

PART 1: THE PUBLIC WEBSITE (built4you.org)

Design Philosophy: "Cyber-Organic Futurism." Think Blade Runner meets Apple. Use a deep, dark theme as a base (not pure black, but a rich #0D0F12) with vibrant, electric accent colors (neon cyan #00F5FF, magenta #FF00C8, electric purple #8A2BE2). Incorporate subtle biomorphic shapes (fluid blobs, organic waves) that contrast with sharp, glass-morphism UI elements.

Sections & Features:

Hero Section:

A dynamic, interactive particle background where particles form the shapes of various business icons (briefcases, wifi symbols, shopping carts) as the mouse moves.

A bold, typographic headline that uses a "typewriter" animation: "We Don't Build Websites. We Build Digital Ecosystems." (With the last two words in a gradient of the accent colors).

A CTA button that doesn't just say "Get Started," but "Initiate System Scan" which triggers a playful, 3-second animation that "analyzes" the visitor's business potential before revealing the contact form.

The "Service Matrix" Section:

Instead of a boring list, present services as a 3x3 grid of interactive, hexagonal cards (like a beehive of activity).

Hovering over a hexagon (e.g., "Front Desk Automation") makes it pulse and expand slightly, while a real-time data visualization (e.g., a live graph of customer wait times dropping) animates on the side of the screen, showing the impact of the service.

Live Client Pulse:

A section titled "The Network is Alive" that shows a real-time, anonymized feed of activity from the client dashboard. For example: "Business X just automated 15 lead follow-ups." or "Cafe Y's Google Profile impressions +27% this week." This provides social proof and demonstrates the platform's power.

The Portal:

The login button for clients shouldn't be a simple link. It should be a stylized, glowing "Iris Scanner" or "Digital Gateway" that, when clicked, performs a sleek animation to transition into the dashboard.

PART 2: THE CLIENT LOGIN DASHBOARD - "THE COMMAND CENTER"

This is where it gets crazy. The dashboard is not a page; it's an immersive cockpit for a business owner.

The Login & Auth:

Seamlessly connect to a secure authentication system (e.g., Auth0 or Supabase).

Upon successful login, perform a full-screen, cinematic transition—like views of a starship cockpit powering up—before landing on the main dashboard.

Dashboard Core Features & Layout:

The Central Hologram:

The centerpiece of the dashboard is a live, interactive 3D data visualization of the client's business. It's a dynamic "tree" or "neural network."

The roots represent foundational services (Website, Google Profile). The branches represent growth (Leads, Sales, Social Reach).

The entire visualization pulses and grows with real data. A new lead makes a node light up and send a pulse through the network. A sale causes a "bloom" effect.

The "N8N Nexus" Panel:

This is the direct link to the n8n workflows. It's not just a list.

It visualizes the client's active automations as a flowing, animated circuit board. Each node in the circuit is a step in their workflow (e.g., "New Form Submission" -> "Add to Google Sheet" -> "Send Welcome Email").

Clients can see the "current" flowing through the circuit in real-time as triggers are activated. They can click a node to see its log or temporarily pause a section of the circuit.

The "Orbital" Metrics Display:

Key metrics (Website Traffic, Conversion Rate, Social Engagement) are displayed not in boxes, but as orbiting "planets" around the central hologram.

Each "planet" is a live graph. Hovering over it enlarges it and shows detailed trends.

The "Mission Control" Task List:

Instead of a to-do list, it's presented as a "System Alert" panel. Tasks from n8n or assigned by you (e.g., "Approve Ad Copy") appear as priority messages with a "Acknowledge" or "Resolve" button.

The "Omni-Channel Inbox":

A unified communication hub that aggregates messages from the client's website contact form, Google Business Profile messages, and social media DMs (if APIs permit). It uses AI to suggest quick, templated responses.

Technical & UX Requirements:

Framework: Use a modern, component-based framework like Next.js or SvelteKit for performance and SEO.

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for utility, but heavily customized with the defined color palette and glass-morphism effects (backdrop-filter: blur(...)).

3D & Graphics: Implement the central hologram and interactive elements using Three.js or a similar WebGL library.

Animations: Use Framer Motion or a similar library for seamless page transitions and micro-interactions. Every action should have a satisfying, purposeful animation.

Real-time Data: Use WebSockets (e.g., with Socket.io) or Server-Sent Events to power the "Live Client Pulse" and the real-time updates within the dashboard.

API Integration: The dashboard must be built to seamlessly integrate with the n8n API to pull workflow data, trigger automations, and update task statuses.

Final Instruction: Do not think in terms of standard templates. This is a bespoke creation. The user experience should feel like stepping into the future of business management. The code should be clean, modular, and well-commented, ready for further expansion. Build something that doesn't just function, but wows.
